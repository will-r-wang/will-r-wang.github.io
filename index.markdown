    <h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Will,</h1>

    <p>
      A data engineer at Shopify part of the <a title='Dev Degree' rel="me" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree program</a> and second-year CS Honours student graduating this August. I work on the side as a teaching assistant, CTO for 5-ing COVID-19, and mentor for peers in STEM. I love neuroscience, computer vision, and all things AI, having previously done deep learning research on the Northern Tornadoes Project. In my spare time, I like singing, ultrarunning, building things, and occasionally - competing in hackathons. <span style="all: unset;" class="dark-mode-toggle">ðŸ’¡</span>
